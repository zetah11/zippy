[x] make patterns generic over the name they expect, to prevent name bugs (like
    in `flattened`)
[x] intern strings, numbers, etc. to avoid clones during passes

        for declarative regions and locals (separation of concerns or smth)
    [ ] reduce duplication between resolving/declaration (they are very similar)
[x] debuggify cli diagnostic span code
